This project contains various reusable pieces of code from my different Symfony-based projects which can be copy-pasted to other projects. New ideas can be born here to merge them with upstream projects or to create useful extensions. This project is not intended to be used standalone.

The name of this repository is inspired by [libegg](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libegg).
